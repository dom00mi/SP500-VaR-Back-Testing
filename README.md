# Stock Market Indexes Analysis and VaR Back-Testing
In this project, I woud like to use various indexes historical data to implement a back-testing framework of a given Value-at-Risk of chosen confidence and time-frame, identifying various kind of VaR breaches.

I would like to implement a streamlined approach that generates returns, standard deviations and Normal Value-at-risks calculation, which can be deployed for different indexes, and can be adjusted for different time period, chosen at the reader's discretion.

I also want to generate some useful graphs for each index, that will help the reader the context behind the choice of the Normal VaR back-testing.
